# Cultural evolution models

Miscellaneous models relating in one way or another to cultural evolution.

## Urn-based signalling (`signal_learning_game.ipynb`)

Learning signalling strategies for two-player signalling game using a simple
form of reinforcement learning. Adapted from the model described by Argiento
et al. (2009) 'Learning to Signal: Analysis of a micro-level reinforcement model'


## First-mover advantage in network development (`first_movers_in_networks.ipynb`)

Model trying to explore how first-mover advantage in networks might interact with
preferential attachment based on some score of 'quality' which is independent
of network structure. Very much a work in progress.
